## Why another rendition of FileSystemWatcher?
The FileSystemWatcher is great for demo apps. For production code? Not so much. Swatcher was written from the ground-up to replace FileSystemWatcher and add the features you need: speed, reliability, events raised when they're supposed to be and an intuitive API that's awesome. Heck, it even provides both observables and events to cater to your coding style.

## Building

To build Swatcher just open the `Swatcher.sln` in Visual Studio.

Note that Swatcher has been compiled against the .Net 4.6.2 Framework.

## Licensing

### Swatcher

Swatcher is licensed under the RPL 1.5 license. More details can be found [here](LICENSE.md).

### Features
* No false change notifications when a file system item is created, deleted or renamed.
* When a large file is being uploaded, copied or moved, Swatcher will wait until the IO operations are completed before sending a creation notice.
* In addition to the aforementioned, `SwatcherCreatedEventArgs` includes a `ProcessingTime` property to inform you as to how long the IO operation took.
* In the `ISwatcherConfig`, you can specify a custom filter for `Created`, `Changed`, `Deleted` and `Renamed` events so an event is never raised for stuff you're not interested in.
* I added `LibLog` to enable developers to "hook" diagnostic info as a Swatcher is processing file system events. Thus, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate a Swatcher with whatever logging mechanism you're using. Create an issue for info your interested in and I will consider adding it to the library!

### Installation
Swatcher is installed using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swatcher/):
`Install-Package Swatcher`

### Configuring a Swatcher
```c#
private static ISwatcherConfig CreateConfiguration()
{
    BraveLantern.Swatcher.Logging.LogProvider.SetCurrentLogProvider(new ColoredConsoleLogProvider());

    //The swatcherId parameter is optional in case you don't want to use it. It really comes 
    //in handy when you are creating several Swatchers at runtime and you need to know from  
    //which Swatcher an event is being raised.
    //var swatcherId = 12345;

    //The folderPath parameter is the path to a folder that you want Swatcher to watch.
    //UNC paths are not supported! If you want to monitor a network folder, you need to map
    //it as a drive.
    var folderPath = @"C:\Users\Martin\Desktop\Monitored";

    //The changeTypes parameter is an bitwise OR of the change types that you want Swatcher to tell you about.
    //see docs here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t6xf43e0(v=vs.110).aspx
    var changeTypes = WatcherChangeTypes.All;

    //The itemTypes parameter is used to tell Swatcher if you want to be notified of changes to files, folders,
    //or both.
    var itemTypes = SwatcherItemTypes.All;

    //see docs here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.notifyfilters(v=vs.110).aspx
    var notificationFilters = SwatcherNotificationTypes.All;

    return new SwatcherConfig(folderPath, changeTypes, itemTypes, notificationFilters, loggingEnabled: true);
}
```

### Consuming a Swatcher
There are two different ways a Swatcher can be consumed:
* [Usage via Events](https://github.com/bravelantern/Swatcher/wiki/Usage-via-Events)
* [Usage via Rx Observables](https://github.com/bravelantern/Swatcher/wiki/Usage-via-Rx-Observables)
